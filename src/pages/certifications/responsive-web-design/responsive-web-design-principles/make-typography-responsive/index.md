## Make Typography Responsive

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The instructions in [this module](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-principles/make-typography-responsive) does not display the code exactly as it would be used in HTML.  For example, the exercise's first viewport unit is listed as follows:

<ul>
  <li>vw: 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width</li>
</ul>

If the above concept were applied to an ```<h2>``` tag via styles, it would look like the following:

```
<style>
   h2 {
    width: 10vw; 
  }
</style>
```

The [Scrimba video](https://scrimba.com/c/crzN7T8) linked below the exercise's Sumbit area displays the code in action.
